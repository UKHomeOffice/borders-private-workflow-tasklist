            <p className="govuk-body">We use information about your email and your name that we hold within the system when we send you a notification. We use the GOV.UK Notify service, to send you notifications from COP to your Home Office email address; this service is operated and assured by the Cabinet Office.</p>

            <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>
